# BindJS
BindJS is an easy implementation for data binding either bidirectional or one-way binding.

<p>BindJS helps you to focus your app logic and forget about data binding with ui dom elements with easy markup declarations: </p>
<ul>
  <li>BindJS supports bidirectional data binding and provides simple interface to access/update app data and ui preferences.</li>
  <li>BindJS supports one-way data binding with binding reference feature.</li>
  <li>BindJS has ability to specify the mapping between app data and dome element properties.</li>
</ul>


# What is next?
<ul>
  <li>Adding support to bind array data.</li>
  <li>Adding support for runtime doms. (Currently binding contexts are just registered for static doms in the page) </li>
  <li>Adding ability to bind dom events with app context.</li>
</ul>


# Thank you!
